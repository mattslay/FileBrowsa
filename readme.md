# FileBrowsa

A simple Windows GUI app to browse files in a folder, much like Windows Explorer. 

**One big thing about this utility is that it supports command line parameters when launching the app so you can pass the initial starting folder, and a filter or filemask expression to apply to the file list.  Also, uou can also launch the default Windows app to open any file by double-clicking on the filename.**
 
 (Full disclosure, the starting point for this app was a project I found on Code Project written by Russell Mangel. Link in credits below.) 

Command line example:
```dos
FileBrowsa "C:\MyPath" "*.pdf"
```
